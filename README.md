Go simple API using the net/http library. No 3rd part library imported was the purpose of this demo

Go's bult-in net/http package is very interesting, as it allows you to make an http server from the scratch without relying on 3rd party libraries.

There is some verbosity and boileplate here though, especially for me as a beginner with the http library.

I saw it as a chance to see how go handles the server requests natively..

My whole experience is, there are options easier than the native http library, but it was worth the time seeing how things are running under the hood.
